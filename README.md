### Project Scope
Development of an application for colour detection in outfits for people with colour blindness
The developed application has two main features:
Colour Detection: Using the smartphone's camera, the app can detect colours in the user's outfit and tell them the name of the colour. This is very helpful for those who cannot distinguish certain colours.
Clothing Recommendations: Based on the detected colours, the app also provides suitable clothing recommendations. With this feature, users can ensure that the clothes they choose always match and look good.
